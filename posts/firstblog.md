This is my first blog on this platform, I'll keep adding more stuff as time passes by, below is a self explanatory code just for testing ðŸ™‚

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 24;
    float weight = 73.5555555;
    char* name = "Abid";
    printf("hello, %s\nAge is %i\nWeight is %.2f",name, age, weight);

}
```
